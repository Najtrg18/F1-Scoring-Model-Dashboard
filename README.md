# F1-Scoring-Model-Dashboard

# [Link Project Overview] (https://github.com/Najtrg18/F1-Scoring-Model-Dashboard/blob/main/F1_presentation.pdf)

# Data 
Sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

# Project Objective 
Implement a scoring model and a dashboard

# Constraints
- Interactive dashboard, built with 2 APIs (Front-end and Back-end)
- Dashboard showing customer's information, and comparison to others
- Dashboard showing credit score and its local/global interpretation

# Competencies
- Dashboard creation and visualisation on the cloud 
- Feature Engineering : Onehot, Business ratios
- Data Balancing : RandomUnderSampling, SMOTE, class_weight 
- Feature Scaling : StandardScaler, RobustScaler, MinMaxScaler
- Algotithms : Logistics Regression, KNN, LightGBM
- Evaluation : Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall, Precision , F1 score, AUC score, execution time
- Gain function : 
- Interpretability : SHAP library
- Front-end environment : Streamlit 
- Back-end environment : Flask + AWS 

# Presentation Feedback from Evaluator
- Good presentation of the subject.
- Visualization of source file relationships.
- Proportion of solvency --> balance.
- Feature Engineering: several transformations carried out.
- 3 Options to manage the imbalance of the target --> selected Smote.
- Matrix of confusion.
- Metric AUC used. AUC of 0.72.
- Sampling
- Methology representing the modeling strategy.
- Gain function according to the classification threshold.
- Interpretability with SHAP, global and local level.
- Dashboard: good understanding of the differences between the Frontend/Backend.
- Using StreamLit for the Frontend / Flask for Backend
- Good explanation with the diagram.
